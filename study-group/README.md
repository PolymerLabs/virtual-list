# Virtual scroller study group

This subdirectory contains studies of existing virtual scroller controls in various ecosystems, both on the web and elsewhere. These are useful to inform the capabilities of the built-in virtual scroller element proposed in this repository.

In addition to studies, we also have a [requirements document](./REQUIREMENTS.md) which we put together based on these studies.

If you would like to contribute your own study to the study group, please feel free to send a pull request; we would love to have more. Try to follow the format of the existing studies to some degree, but there are no strict rules.
